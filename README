printf("Farewell Dennis Ritchie\n");

Quotes around the net:
"His pointer has been cast to void *; his process has terminated with exit code 0."
"If you seek his monument, log in."
"He made things, that made things."

This program is written in a language that heavily borrows from C, the language created by Dennis Ritchie.
This program will also run in a clone or a descendant of Unix, the operating system of which he was a key developer. 

This is a very sad week indeed. :(
